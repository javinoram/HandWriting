## Main details
The application was done using the Next.js framework with React.

An important detail that I discover when I try to create the web interface is how to link the different components in the navbar. Into the app folder, for each component I need to create a new folder for each component and inside of it create a new javascript file called page. With this, I can link each component without errors.

To execute the web inteface, just execute the below command.

```bash
npm run dev
```

This one, will run the interface in the [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) port.
